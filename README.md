# Classify-Quranic-audio-clips-by-Tajweed-rule

Overview
Understanding the rules of Tajweed—the art of Quranic pronunciation—is critical for preserving the linguistic and spiritual integrity of Quran recitation. In this competition, your goal is to build an AI system that classifies short audio clips of Quran recitation based on the Tajweed rule applied to Noon Saakinah and Tanween letters.

Participants will work with real recitations from multiple sheikhs, aiming to correctly identify rules like Ikhfa, Idgham, Izhar, and Iqlab
