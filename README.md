# 🕌 Tajweed Rule Classification from Quran Recitations  
🎧 *Deep Learning with EfficientNet on Log-Mel Spectrograms*

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository presents a full **end-to-end pipeline** for classifying Tajweed rules from Quranic recitations using deep learning.  
The model leverages **EfficientNet-B0** trained on **log-Mel spectrograms** derived from audio clips.

The project includes:

- ✅ Audio preprocessing & exploratory data analysis
- ✅ Custom PyTorch Dataset class
- ✅ Waveform + spectrogram augmentations
- ✅ Stratified K-Fold CV training with Focal Loss
- ✅ Test-time augmentation (TTA) for inference
- ✅ Ensemble predictions and final submission

## 🎛️ Configuration & Hyperparameters

Below we define key constants used throughout the pipeline:

```python
# Audio parameters
SAMPLE_RATE = 16_000       # Hz
MAX_SEC     = 6.0          # seconds
MAX_LEN     = int(SAMPLE_RATE * MAX_SEC)

# Training parameters
BATCH   = 64
EPOCHS  = 10
LR      = 3e-4
K_FOLDS = 5
```
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explore:
	•	Distribution of sheikh_name in train and test
	•	Histogram of label_name (Tajweed rule distribution)
	•	Audio duration histogram
	•	RMS energy and waveform mean energy
	•	Detection of short (< 0.5s) or leaked audio samples

⸻

🧹 Data Cleaning

We perform the following:
	•	✅ Remove duplicated audio (using SHA-256 waveform hash)
	•	✅ Remove very short audios in train set (< 0.5 sec)
	•	ℹ️ Short audios in test set are logged but not removed

⸻

🎶 Feature Extraction: Log-Mel Spectrograms

Each .wav file is:
	•	Resampled to 16kHz
	•	Converted to mono
	•	Padded or trimmed to 6 seconds
	•	Transformed into a log-Mel spectrogram (3×96×T)

Normalization is done using GLOBAL_MEAN and GLOBAL_STD computed over the training set.

⸻

🧾 Dataset Class (TajweedSpecDataset)

Handles:
	•	Log-Mel spectrogram transformation
	•	Waveform augmentations:
	•	Gaussian noise
	•	Time stretching (SoX-based)
	•	Volume gain
	•	Spec augmentations:
	•	Time masking
	•	Frequency masking
